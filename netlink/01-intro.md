# Netlink Introduction

* `Netlink` is a `socket based protocol` for communication between `kernel space` and `user space`.

* `Netlink` is a technique to perform `IPC` between `user space` and `kernel space`.

* `Netlink` provide a clean bidirectional communication channel between `user space` and `kernel space`.

* `Netlink` provides a `unified interface` (via the `socket abstraction`) when communicating with the kernel.
